/**
 * Utility class which provides encryption and decryption functionality within the framework.  As the class name implies,
 * the chosen cipher/algorithm for encrypting values is the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cipher, established by the
 * U.S. NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), with the CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) variation for defining
 * the mode of operation for this algorithm.
 * <p>
 * The cryptographic key (i.e. secret key) used for encryption/decryption is a password-based AES-192 (i.e. 192 bit key)
 * variation.  Because this is password-based, the AES secret key used for encryption/decryption is derived from a given
 * password.  For generating this password-based key, a PBKDF2 password-based key derivation function and salt value is
 * used for turning the password into a secret key.
 *
